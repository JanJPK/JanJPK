- Hi, Iâ€™m Jan
- I like .NET tech stack and backend programming the most
- My GitHub wasn't very active for the past year since I wanted to do something else than programming in my free time after a hard years of studying and working fulltime simultaneously
- I enjoy wood working, fixing my classic sportscar and building with lego
